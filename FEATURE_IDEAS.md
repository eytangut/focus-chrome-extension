# Focus Extension - Feature Ideas and Improvements

## 10 Ideas for Features and Improvements

### 1. **Time-Based Blocking Schedules**
- Allow users to set different blocking rules for different times of day
- Example: Social media blocked during work hours (9-5), gaming sites blocked in evening
- Integration with calendar APIs to block based on scheduled meetings/work blocks

### 2. **Focus Sessions with Pomodoro Integration**
- Start a "focus session" that temporarily tightens blocking for a set duration
- Built-in Pomodoro timer with break allowances
- Progressive rewards system for completing focus sessions

### 3. **Website Category Intelligence**
- AI automatically categorizes websites (social media, news, shopping, work tools, etc.)
- Users can set blocking policies per category instead of individual sites
- Machine learning to improve categorization over time

### 4. **Productivity Scoring and Analytics**
- Track time spent on different categories of websites
- Daily/weekly productivity reports
- Identify patterns and suggest optimal blocking strategies
- Integration with time tracking tools like RescueTime

### 5. **Team/Family Sharing Features**
- Parents can manage children's browsing with AI assistance
- Team leaders can set organization-wide focus policies
- Shared whitelists and blacklists for groups
- Anonymous productivity challenges between team members

### 6. **Context-Aware Location Blocking**
- Different blocking rules based on location (home vs office vs library)
- GPS integration to automatically switch profiles
- Meeting room detection to enable ultra-focus mode

### 7. **Advanced AI Conversation Features**
- Voice-to-text for hands-free AI conversations
- Multi-language support for international users
- AI remembers past conversations and user preferences
- Integration with personal assistants (Siri, Google Assistant)

### 8. **Behavioral Psychology Integration**
- Implement proven behavioral techniques (friction, nudges, habit stacking)
- Gradual reduction algorithms to wean users off problematic sites
- Positive reinforcement systems with micro-rewards
- Integration with habit tracking apps

### 9. **Emergency and Context Override System**
- Smart emergency detection (breaking news, personal emergencies)
- Work context detection (urgent emails, calendar conflicts)
- Temporary "boss mode" that allows all work-related sites
- Integration with communication platforms (Slack, Teams)

### 10. **Advanced Customization and Power User Features**
- Custom JavaScript rules for complex blocking logic
- API for integration with other productivity tools
- Custom AI prompt templates for different use cases
- Advanced scheduling with recurring patterns
- Backup and sync across devices with encrypted cloud storage

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Next Release):**
- Time-based blocking schedules
- Website category intelligence
- Productivity scoring basics

**Medium Priority:**
- Focus sessions with Pomodoro
- Team sharing features
- Behavioral psychology integration

**Long-term Vision:**
- Advanced AI features
- Location-aware blocking
- Emergency override systems
- Power user customization

## User Feedback Integration

These ideas should be validated through:
- User surveys and feedback collection
- A/B testing of new features
- Analytics on feature usage patterns
- Community voting on most wanted features

## Technical Considerations

- All features should maintain privacy-first approach
- Local storage preferred over cloud for sensitive data
- Performance impact should be minimal
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave)
- Accessibility compliance for all UI features
